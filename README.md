**Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver**

**Overview**

This project provides a GUI-based Java application to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Branch and Bound algorithm. Users can input city names, define distances between them, and visualize the optimal path on a graphical panel.

**Features**

Input the number of cities.

Assign names to cities.

Enter distances between cities.

Solve TSP using the Branch and Bound algorithm.

Display the optimal path and total distance.

Visualize the travel animation between cities.

Reset the interface for new inputs.

**Technologies Used**

Java Swing for GUI components

Branch and Bound algorithm for solving TSP

Threading for smooth animation

**How to Use**

Run the program by executing the TSPSolverGUI class.

Enter the number of cities and submit.

Provide names for each city and submit.

Enter the distance matrix.

Click Solve TSP to compute the optimal path.

View the path and animation in the graphical panel.

Click Stop Animation to halt movement.

Click Reset to start over.
